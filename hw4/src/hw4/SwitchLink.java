/**
 * Models a switchable link with three paths. A boolean turn determines which path trains take. By default turn is set to false. The following figure shows the three paths labeled A, B, and C.
 A     B
 --- ---
     \
      \C
 
The paths A and B run in the same direction and C branches away.
When turn is true a train from A passes to C.
When turn is false a train from A passes to B.
A train from B always passes to A.
A train from C always passes to A.
The turn cannot be modified when the train is in the crossing.
